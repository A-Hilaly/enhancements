## Summary

This proposal is to introduce a VolumeGroup API to manage multiple volumes together and a VolumeGroupSnapshot API to take a snapshot of a VolumeGroup. It also attempts to address other use cases such as volume placement.

## Motivation

While there is already a KEP (https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/pull/1051) that introduces APIs to do application snapshot, backup, and restore, there are other use cases not covered by that KEP.

### Use cases for this KEP

* A VolumeGroup allows users to manage multiple volumes belonging to the same application together and therefore it is very useful in general. For example, it can be used to group all volumes in the same StatefulSet together and we can take a group snapshot of all the volumes in this StatefulSet.

* For some storage systems, volumes are always managed in a group. For these storage systems, they will have to create a group for a single volume if they need to implement a create volume function in Kubernetes. Volume snapshotting, cloning, expansion, and deletion, etc. are all performed at a group level. Providing a VolumeGroup API will be very convenient for them.

* Instead of taking individual snapshots one after another, VolumeGroup can be used as a source for taking a snapshot of all the volumes in the same volume group. This may be a storage level consistent group snapshot if the storage system supports it. In any case, when used together with quiesce hooks, this group snapshot can be application consistent. For this use case, we will introduce another CRD VolumeGroupSnapshot.

* VolumeGroup can also be used together with application snapshot. It can be a resource managed by the ApplicationSnapshot CRD.

* Some applications may not want to use ApplicationSnapshot CRD because they donâ€™t use Kubernetes workload APIs such as StatefulSet, Deployment, etc. Instead, they have developed their own operators. In this case it is more convenient to use VolumeGroup to manage persistent volumes used in those applications.

* Application quiesce is time consuming. Some users may not want to do application quiesce very frequently for that reason. For example, a user may want to run weekly backups with application quiesce and nightly backups without application quiesce but with consistency group support which provides crash consistency across all volumes in the group.

### Future use cases

* VolumeGroup can be used to manage group replication or consistency group replication if the storage system supports it. Note replication is out of scope for this proposal. It is mentioned here as a potential future use case.

* VolumeGroup can be used to manage volume placement to either spread the volumes across storage pools or stack the volumes on the same storage pool. Related KEPs proposing the concept of storage pool for volume placement is as follows:
  https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/pull/1353
  https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/pull/1347
We may not really need a VolumeGroup for this use case. A StoragePool is probably enough. This is to be determined.

### Goals

* Provide an API to manage multiple volumes together in a group.
* Provide an API to take a snapshot of a group of volumes.
* The group API should be generic and extensible so that it may be used to support other features in the future.

### Non Goals

* A VolumeGroup may potentially be used to support group replication in the future, but providing design on replication group is not in the scope of this KEP. This can be discussed in the future.
* Provide a design to facilitate volume placement using the group API (To be determined).

## Proposal for VolumeGroup and VolumeGroupSnapshot

This proposal introduces new CRDs VolumeGroup, VolumeGroupContent, VolumeGroupClass, VolumeGroupSnapshot, VolumeGroupSnapshotContent, and VolumeGroupSnapshotClass.

### Create VolumeGroup

Create new VolumeGroup can be done in several ways:

Phase 1 (Note: only Phase 1 will be covered in this KEP which is targeting Alpha in K8s v1.26):
1. Create an empty group first, then create a new PVC with the group name. This will create a new volume and add that volume to the already created group. When deleting this volume group, all volumes in the group will be deleted together with the group. A CSI driver supporting CREATE_DELETE_VOLUME_GROUP controller capability MUST implement this feature.
2. Create an empty group first, then add an existing PVC to the group one by one. A CSI driver supporting VOLUME_GROUP_ADD_REMOVE_EXISTING_VOLUME MUST implement this feature.

Phase 2 (After v1.26):
1. Create a new volume group by querying a label on existing persistent volume claims and adding them to the volume group.
2. Create a new volume group from an existing group snapshot or another volume group in one step. Design details will be added in a future KEP.
2. Non-goal: Create a new empty group and in the same time create new empty PVCs and add to the new group.

### Modify VolumeGroup

Modify an existing VolumeGroup:
1. Create a new volume with an existing VolumeGroup name will create a new volume and add it to the group. Option 1 of creating VolumeGroup above falls into this case. As mentioned earlier, a CSI driver supporting CREATE_DELETE_VOLUME_GROUP MUST implement this feature.
2. Add an existing volume to an existing VolumeGroup or remove a volume from a VolumeGroup. Option 2 of creating VolumeGroup above falls into this case. As mentioned earlier, a CSI driver supporting VOLUME_GROUP_ADD_REMOVE_EXISTING_VOLUME MUST implement this feature.

### Create and Modify VolumeGroup

VolumeGroups can be created and/or modified in several ways as described in the following.

#### Create new PVC and add to the VolumeGroup

* Admin creates a VolumeGroupClass, with the SupportVolumeGroupSnapshot boolean flag set to true.
* User creates a new empty VolumeGroup, specifying the above VolumeGroupClass. As a result, a new empty VolumeGroupContent will also be created and bound to the VolumeGroup.
* User creates a new PVC with an existing VolumeGroup name created above. As a result, a new PVC is created and added to VolumeGroup. VolumeGroup is modified so Status has this new PVC in PVCList.
* External-provisioner will be modified so that VolumeGroupName will be passed to the CSI driver when creating a volume.

Only CSI drivers supporting CREATE_DELETE_VOLUME_GROUP capability can support the volume group this way.

When a new PVC is created with the existing VolumeGroup name, the VolumeGroup will be modified and the PVC will be added to PVCList in the Status, and the VolumeGroupContent will also be modified and the PV will be added to the PVList in the Status.

The same PVC can belong to different groups, i.e., different types of groups or different groups of the same type, if the storage system supports it. Storage system will decide whether to support this or not. If it does not support it, an INVALID_ARGUMENT error code should be returned with a message explaining why. We don't prevent it in the API or controller directly.

#### Modify VolumeGroup with existing PVCs

We can add an existing PVC to the group or remove a PVC from the group without deleting it. A VOLUME_GROUP_ADD_REMOVE_EXISTING_VOLUME capability will be added to CSI Spec. Only CSI drivers supporting both CREATE_DELETE_VOLUME_GROUP and VOLUME_GROUP_ADD_REMOVE_EXISTING_VOLUME capabilities can support the volume group this way.

* Admin creates a VolumeGroupClass, with the SupportVolumeGroupSnapshot boolean flag set to true.
* User creates a new empty VolumeGroup, specifying the above VolumeGroupClass. A new empty VolumeGroupContent will also be created and bound to the VolumeGroup.
* Add an existing PVC to an existing VolumeGroup (VolumeGroup can be empty to start with or it can have other PVCs already) by adding VolumeGroup name as a label to the PVC.
  * The VolumeGroup name is added by user to each PVC, not by the VolumeGroup controller. The VolumeGroup controller watches PVCs and reacts to the PVC updated with a VolumeGroup name event as described in the following step.
* VolumeGroup is modified so the existing PVC is added to the PVCList in the Status. VolumeGroupContent is also modified so the PV is added to the PVList in the Status.
  * Note: The VolumeGroup controller will be implemented to have a desired state
    of the world and an actual state of the world. The desired state of the world
    contains VolumeGroups with the desired PVCList while the actual state of the
    world contains VolumeGroups with the actual PVCList. The controller will try
    to reconcile the two by handling adding and removing multiple PVCs through a
    single CSI ModifyVolumeGroup RPC call each time.
* External-provisioner will be modified to update the status of PVC and PV.
* VolumeGroup controller will be triggered to update the VolumeGroup Status and VolumeGroupContent Status.
* If one volume fails to be added, it should not affect it if it is used by a pod, but there will be error messages.
* Removing a PVC from a VolumeGroup will trigger the external-provisioner and the VolumeGroup controller as well.

#### Phase 2: Create VolumeGroup from VolumeGroupSnapshot or another VolumeGroup

This is in Phase 2 so won't be discussed in detail here. Creating a new volume group from an existing group snapshot will be supported in Phase 2 if the CSI driver supports VOLUME_GROUP_FROM_GROUP_SNAPSHOT capability. As a result, PVCs will be created from source snapshots and placed in a new volume group.

#### Pre-provisioned VolumeGroup

Admin can create a VolumeGroupContent, specifying an existing VolumeGroupHandle in the storage system and specifying a VolumeGroup name and namespace. Then the user creates a VolumeGroup that points to the VolumeGroupContent name.

Admin will retrieve all volumeHandles in the VolumeGroup from the storage system, create PVs pointing to the volumeHandles. Then the user creates PVCs pointing to the PVs.

### Create VolumeGroupSnapshot

A VolumeGroupSnapshot can be created with a VolumeGroup as the source if the CSI driver supports the CREATE_DELETE_GROUP_SNAPSHOT capability.

#### Dynamic provisioning

* Admin creates a VolumeGroupSnapshotClass.
* User creates a VolumeGroupSnapshot with a VolumeGroup as the source.
* This will trigger the VolumeGroupSnapshot controller to create a VolumeGroupSnapshotContent API object, and also call the CreateVolumeGroupSnapshot CSI function and also create multiple VolumeSnapshot API objects with VolumeGroupSnapshot name parameter in each VolumeSnapshot Status. This will trigger the creation of VolumeSnapshotContent API objects in the snapshot controller and calls to the CreateSnapshot CSI function in the CSI snapshotter sidecar. The CSI snapshotter sidecar will pass the new group_snapshot_name parameter to the CSI Driver when calling CreatSnapshot.
* When CSI driver receives CreateSnapshot request for individual snapshots with a VolumeGroupSnapshot name:
  * If it knows how to create a group snapshot on the storage system, it returns (nil, nil), and leaves it to the CreateVolumeGroupSnapshot function to handle the snapshot creation.
* CreateVolumeGroupSnapshot CSI function response
  * The CreateVolumeGroupSnapshot CSI function should return a list of snapshots (Snapshot message defined in CSI Spec) in its response. The VolumeGroupSnapshot controller can use the returned list of snapshots to update corresponding individual VolumeSnapshotContents, wait for VolumeSnapshots and VolumeSnapshotContents to be bound, and update SnapshotList in the VolumeGroupSnapshot Status and SnapshotContentList in the VolumeGroupSnapshotContent Status.

apiVersion: snapshot.storage.k8s.io/v1
```
kind: VolumeSnapshot
metadata:
  name: snapshot1
spec:
  volumeSnapshotClassName: snapClass1
  source:
    persistentVolumeClaimName: pvc1
status:
  volumeGroupSnapshotName: groupSnapshot1
```

* An admissions controller or finalizer should be added to prevent an individual snapshot from being deleted that belongs to a VolumeGroupSnapshot.
* Since some storage systems require individual snapshots while others can only return a single group snapshot but not individual snapshots, we propose a two phase solution.
  * In Phase 1, since we do not support creating a VolumeGroup directly from a VolumeGroupSnapshot, it is required for individual snapshots to be returned along with the group snapshot.
  * In Phase 2, we plan to support creating a VolumeGroup directly from a VolumeGroupSnapshot. We propose the following solution for Phase 2:
    * In VolumeGroupSnapshotStatus, if ReadyToUse is true and SnapshotList is empty, the VolumeGroupSnapshot Controller assumes the storage system does not return individual snapshots.
    * If ReadyToUse is true and SnapshotList is not empty, the VolumeGroupSnapshot Controller knows there are individual snapshots created for this group. Those individual snapshots may be used as readonly, but they cannot be removed from the VolumeGroupSnapshot.
    * In the CSI Spec, this means repeated .csi.v1.Snapshot snapshots in VolumeGroupSnapshot message from CreateVolumeGroupSnapshotResponse should be optional, not required.
    * How to use the VolumeGroupSnapshot if individual snapshots are not returned? How can we create a volume from a snapshot if there are no individual snapshots? `snapshots` is optional while `group_snapshot_id` is required in VolumeGroupSnapshot message in CSI so it is fine to only specify `group_snapshot_id` not `snapshots` when creating a VolumeGroup from a VolumeGroupSnapshot. However, CSI Driver MUST return a list of `volumes` that are restored in `CreateVolumeGroupResponse`.

#### Pre-provisioned VolumeGroupSnapshot

Admin can create a VolumeGroupSnapshotContent, specifying an existing VolumeGroupSnapshotHandle in the storage system and specifying a VolumeGroupSnapshot name and namespace. Then the user creates a VolumeGroupSnapshot that points to the VolumeGroupSnapshotContent name.

Admin will retrieve all volumeSnapshotHandles in the Volume Group Snapshot from the storage system, create VolumeSnapshotContents pointing to the volumeSnapshotHandles. Then the user can create VolumeSnapshots pointing to the VolumeSnapshotContents.

### Delete VolumeGroupSnapshot

A VolumeGroupSnapshot can be deleted if the CSI driver supports the CREATE_DELETE_GROUP_SNAPSHOT capability.
* When a VolumeGroupSnapshot is deleted, the VolumeGroupSnapshot controller will call the DeleteVolumeGroupSnapshot CSI function as well as DeleteSnapshot CSI functions.
  * Since CSI driver handles individual snapshot creation in CreateVolumeGroupSnapshot, it should handle individual snapshot deletion in DeleteVolumeGroupSnapshot.
* DeleteSnapshot on a single snapshot that belongs to a group snapshot is not allowed.

### Restore

Restore can be done as follows:

Phase 1:

* A new empty volume group can be created first, and then a new volume can be created from a snapshot one by one and added to the volume group. This can be repeated for all the snapshots in the VolumeGroupSnapshot.

Phase 2:

* A VolumeGroup can be created from a VolumeGroupSnapshot or VolumeGroup source in one step. This is the same as what is described in the section `Create VolumeGroup from VolumeGroupSnapshot or another VolumeGroup`.

### Risks and Mitigations

This feature requires coordination between several controllers including the newly proposed volume group and group snapshot controller and existing external-provisioner and external-snapshotter components. We will introduce this feature as alpha and add tests to make sure it works properly.

## Design Details

### Test Plan

##### Prerequisite testing updates
N/A

##### Unit tests
* Unit tests for external volume group and group snapshot controller.
* Unit tests for modified code path of external-provisioner and external-snapshotter.

##### Integration tests
Integration tests are not needed.

##### e2e tests
* e2e tests for external volume group and group snapshot controller.
* e2e tests for modified code path of external-provisioner and external-snapshotter.
* Add stress and scale tests before moving from beta to GA.

### Graduation Criteria
#### Alpha
* Initial feature implementation, including:
  * Volume group.
  * Volume group snapshot.
* Sample implementation in the csi-driver-host-path.
* Reviews from vendors whose storage systems can support this feature.
* Add basic unit tests.

#### Alpha -> Beta
* Unit tests and e2e tests outlined in design proposal implemented.

#### Beta -> GA
* Volume group and group snapshot support is added to multiple CSI drivers.
* Volume group and group snapshot feature deployed in production and have gone through at least one K8s upgrade.

#### Deprecation
<!--
- Announce deprecation and support policy of the existing flag
- Two versions passed since introducing the functionality that deprecates the flag (to address version skew)
- Address feedback on usage/changed behavior, provided on GitHub issues
- Deprecate the flag
-->
No deprecation plan.

### Upgrade / Downgrade Strategy

<!--
If applicable, how will the component be upgraded and downgraded? Make sure
this is in the test plan.

Consider the following in developing an upgrade/downgrade strategy for this
enhancement:
- What changes (in invocations, configurations, API use, etc.) is an existing
  cluster required to make on upgrade, in order to maintain previous behavior?
- What changes (in invocations, configurations, API use, etc.) is an existing
  cluster required to make on upgrade, in order to make use of the enhancement?
-->
External controllers handling volume group and group snapshot are additional sidecars deployed with the CSI driver. External-snapshotter and external-provisioner components will be updated to use the newer version that supports this feature. Upgrade should be fine as long as all the components are updated accordingly. Before downgrade, newly created volume groups and group snapshots which depend on the new CRDs should be deleted.

### Version Skew Strategy

<!--
If applicable, how will the component handle version skew with other
components? What are the guarantees? Make sure this is in the test plan.

Consider the following in developing a version skew strategy for this
enhancement:
- Does this enhancement involve coordinating behavior in the control plane and
  in the kubelet? How does an n-2 kubelet without this feature available behave
  when this feature is used?
- Will any other components on the node change? For example, changes to CSI,
  CRI or CNI may require updating that component before the kubelet.
-->
The enhancement only affects the control plane but there are multiple components involved. If the controllers are updated to support this feature but the CSI driver itself does not support it, the `Ready` status of a new VolumeGroup API object will stay `false`.

#### PersistentVolumeClaim and PersistentVolume

For PersistentVolumeClaim, the user can request it to be added to a VolumeGroup by adding a label with the VolumeGroup name, i.e., volumegroup.storage.k8s.io/volumegroup:volumeGroup1. In the initial phase, no changes will be proposed to PersistentVolumeClaim and PersistentVolume API objects. Before moving to Beta, we will re-evaluate this.

#### VolumeSnapshot and VolumeSnapshotContent

For VolumeSnapshot, we cannot request a VolumeSnapshot to be added to be VolumeGroupSnapshot, therefore VolumeGroupSnapshotName is only in the Status but not in the Spec.

```
type VolumeSnapshotStatus struct{
	......
        // +optional
        VolumeGroupSnapshotName *string
	......
}

type VolumeSnapshotContentStatus struct{
	......
        // +optional
        VolumeGroupSnapshotContentName *string
	......
}
```

### Example Yaml Files

#### Create Volume Group

Example yaml files to create a VolumeGroupClass and a VolumeGroup are in the following.

Create a VolumeGroupClass that supports volumeGroupSnapshot:
```
apiVersion: volumegroup.storage.k8s.io/v1alpha1
kind: VolumeGroupClass
metadata:
  name: volumeGroupClass1
spec:
  parameters:
     â€¦...
 supportVolumeGroupSnapshot: true
```

Create a VolumeGroup belongs to this VolumeGroupClass:
```
apiVersion: volumegroup.storage.k8s.io/v1alpha1
kind: VolumeGroup
metadata:
  Name: volumeGroup1
spec:
  volumeGroupClassName: volumeGroupClass1
```

#### Add PVC to VolumeGroup

Create a PVC that belongs to the volume group which supports volumeGroupSnapshot:
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: pvc1
  labels:
    volumegroup.storage.k8s.io/volumegroup:volumeGroup1
spec:
  accessModes:
  - ReadWriteOnce
  dataSource: null
  resources:
	requests:
  	storage: 1Gi
  storageClassName: storageClass1
  volumeMode: Filesystem
  volumeGroupNames: [volumeGroup1]
```

#### Create VolumeGroupSnapshot

Create a VolumeGroupSnapshotClass:
```
apiVersion: volumegroup.storage.k8s.io/v1alpha1
kind: VolumeGroupSnapshotClass
metadata:
  name: volumeGroupSnapshotClass1
spec:
  parameters:
     â€¦...
```

A VolumeGroupSnapshot taken from the VolumeGroup dynamically:
```
apiVersion: volumegroup.storage.k8s.io/v1alpha1
kind: VolumeGroupSnapshot
metadata:
  name: my-group-snapshot
spec:
  source:
      volumeGroupName: volumeGroup1
  volumeGroupSnapshotClassName: volumeGroupSnapshotClass1
```

A new external VolumeGroup controller will handle VolumeGroupClass, VolumeGroup, and VolumeGroupContent resources. We may need to split this into two controllers, one common controller that handles common functions such as binding, and one sidecar controller that calls the CSI driver.

External provisioner will be modified to read information from volume groups (through volumeGroupNames) and pass them down to the CSI driver.

A new external VolumeGroupSnapshot controller will handle VolumeGroupSnapshotClass, VolumeGroupSnapshot, and VolumeGroupSnapshotContent resources. We may need to split this into two controllers, one common controller that handles common functions such as binding, and one sidecar controller that calls the CSI driver.

Snapshot controller will be modified to update VolumeSnapshot status. External snapshotter sidecar will be modified to update VolumeSnapshotContent status.

### CSI Changes

#### CSI Capabilities

New controller capabilities CREATE_DELETE_VOLUME_GROUP, VOLUME_GROUP_ADD_REMOVE_EXISTING_VOLUME, CREATE_DELETE_GROUP_SNAPSHOT, INDIVIDUAL_SNAPSHOT_RESTORE, GET_VOLUME_GROUP, GET_VOLUME_GROUP_SNAPSHOT, LIST_VOLUME_GROUPS, LIST_VOLUME_GROUP_SNAPSHOTS will be added.

* CREATE_DELETE_VOLUME_GROUP:
  Indicates that the controller plugin supports creating and deleting a volume group.

* VOLUME_GROUP_ADD_REMOVE_EXISTING_VOLUME:
  Indicates that the controller plugin supports adding an existing volume to a volume
  group and removing a volume from a volume group without deleting it.

* CREATE_DELETE_GROUP_SNAPSHOT:
  Indicates that the controller plugin supports creating a snapshot of all volumes
  in a volume group.

* INDIVIDUAL_SNAPSHOT_RESTORE:
  Indicates whether the controller plugin supports creating a volume from an
  individual volume snapshot if the volume snapshot is part of a
  VolumeGroupSnapshot. Use cases: selective restore, advanced recovery, etc.
  Note: In Phase 1, this is the only way to restore after taking a group snapshot.
  User can create a volume from a volume snapshot for all the individual snapshots
  created along the group snapshot.

* GET_VOLUME_GROUP:
  Indicates that the controller plugin supports getting details of a volume group.

* GET_VOLUME_GROUP_SNAPSHOT:
  Indicates that the controller plugin supports getting details of a volume group snapshot.

* LIST_VOLUME_GROUPS:
  Indicates that the controller plugin supports getting details of a list of volume groups.

* LIST_VOLUME_GROUP_SNAPSHOTS:
  Indicates that the controller plugin supports getting details of a list of volume group snapshots.

#### CSI Controller RPC

```
service Controller {
  â€¦
  rpc CreateVolumeGroup(CreateVolumeGroupRequest)
    returns (CreateVolumeGroupResponse) {
        option (alpha_method) = true;
    }

  rpc CreateVolumeGroupSnapshot(CreateVolumeGroupSnapshotRequest)
    returns (CreateVolumeGroupSnapshotResponse) {
        option (alpha_method) = true;
    }

  rpc ModifyVolumeGroup(ModifyVolumeGroupRequest)
    returns (ModifyVolumeGroupResponse) {
        option (alpha_method) = true;
    }

  rpc DeleteVolumeGroup(DeleteVolumeGroupRequest)
    returns (DeleteVolumeGroupResponse) }
        option (alpha_method) = true;
    }

    returns (DeleteVolumeGroupSnapshotResponse) {
        option (alpha_method) = true;

        option (alpha_method) = true;
    }

  rpc GetVolumeGroupSnapshot(GetVolumeGroupSnapshotRequest)
    returns (GetVolumeGroupSnapshotResponse) {
        option (alpha_method) = true;
    }
  â€¦
}
```

#### CreateVolumeGroup

This RPC will be called by the CO to create a new volume group on behalf of a user.
This operation MUST be idempotent. If a volume group corresponding to the specified volume group name already exists, is compatible with the specified parameters in the CreateVolumeGroupRequest, the Plugin MUST reply 0 OK with the corresponding CreateVolumeGroupResponse.
CSI Plugins MAY create the following types of volume groups:

* Create a new empty volume group.
 * After the empty group is created, create a new volume, specifying the group name in the volume.
* At restore time, create a single volume from individual snapshot and then join an existing group.
 * Create an empty group.
 * Create a volume from snapshot, specifying the group name in the volume.
* Phase 2: Create a new volume group from a source group snapshot or another group.
* Phase 2: Create a new volume group and add a list of existing volumes to the group by querying a label on PVCs.

The following is non-goal:
* Non goal: Create a new group and at the same time create a list of new volumes in the group.

In `VolumeGroupSnapshot` message, `snapshots` is an optional field while `group_snapshot_id` is a required field. It is fine to only specify `group_snapshot_id` but not `snapshots` in `VolumeGroupSnapshot` message at restore time.
However, the Plugin MUST return a list of volumes that are restored in `CreateVolumeGroupResponse`.

```
message CreateVolumeGroupRequest {
  option (alpha_message) = true;

  // suggested name for volume group (required for idempotency)
  // This field is REQUIRED.
  string name = 1;

  // params passed from VolumeGroupClass
  // This field is OPTIONAL.
  map<string, string> parameters = 2;

  // Secrets required by plugin to complete volume group creation request.
  // This field is OPTIONAL. Refer to the `Secrets Requirements`
  // section on how to use this field.
  map<string, string> secrets = 3 [(csi_secret) = true];

  // Phase 2
  // If specified, a volume group will be created from the source group snapshot.
  // This field is OPTIONAL.
  // VolumeGroupSnapshot source_volume_group_snapshot = 4;

  // Phase 2
  // If specified, a volume group will be created from a list of existing volumes.
  // This field is OPTIONAL.
  // repeated string volume_id = 5;
}

message CreateVolumeGroupResponse {
  option (alpha_message) = true;

  // Contains all attributes of the newly created volume group.
  // This field is REQUIRED.
  VolumeGroup volume_group = 1;
}

message VolumeGroup {
  option (alpha_message) = true;

  // The identifier for this volume group, generated by the plugin.
  // This field is REQUIRED.
  string volume_group_id = 1;

  // Opaque static properties of the volume group.
  // This field is OPTIONAL.
  map<string, string> volume_group_context = 2;

  // Underlying volumes in this group. The same definition in CSI Volume.
  // This field is REQUIRED.
  // To support the creation of an empty group, this list can be empty.
  // However, this field is not empty in the following cases:
  // - Response from ListVolumeGroups or GetVolumeGroup if the VolumeGroup is not empty.
  // - Response from ModifyVolumeGroup if the VolumeGroup is not empty after modification.
  // - Phase 2: Create a new volume group from a source group snapshot.
  // - Phase 2: Create a new volume group and add a list of existing volumes to the group.
  repeated .csi.v1.Volume volumes = 3;
}
```

#### CreateVolume

1. When a new volume is created with a volume group id parameter, the volume will be created and added to the existing volume group.
2. A new volume can also be created without a volume group id parameter. It can be added to a volume group later through the ModifyVolumeGroup RPC.

Note that for filesystems based storage systems, only option 1 can be supported. For block based storage systems. Both option 1 and 2 may be supported. However there is a possibility that option 2 will not work for consistency groups as the volume is created without the consideration of which group the volume will be placed in. CSI Spec does not determine whether a group is consistent or not. It is up to the storage provider to decide whether a consistent group can be supported or not and clarify that in vendor specific documentation.

```
message CreateVolumeRequest {
      string name = 1;
      â€¦
      repeated string volume_group_id = 8 [(alpha_field) = true];
}
```

#### DeleteVolumeGroup

```
message DeleteVolumeGroupRequest {
  option (alpha_message) = true;

  // The ID of the volume group to be deprovisioned.
  // This field is REQUIRED.
  string volume_group_id = 1;

  // Secrets required by plugin to complete volume group deletion request.
  // This field is OPTIONAL. Refer to the `Secrets Requirements`
  // section on how to use this field.
  map<string, string> secrets = 2 [(csi_secret) = true];
}

message DeleteVolumeGroupResponse {
  option (alpha_message) = true;
  // Intentionally empty.
}
```

#### ModifyVolumeGroup

This RPC will be called by the CO to modify an existing volumegroup on behalf of a user. volume_ids provided in the ModifyVolumeGroupRequest will be compared to the ones in the existing VolumeGroup. New volume_ids in the modified VolumeGroup will be added to the VolumeGroup. Existing volume_ids not in the modified VolumeGroup will be removed from the VolumeGroup. If volume_ids is empty, the VolumeGroup will be removed of all existing volumes. This operation MUST be idempotent.

To support ModifyVolumeGroup, the Kubernetes VolumeGroup controller will be implemented to have a desired state of the world and an actual state of the world. The desired state of the world contains VolumeGroups with the desired PVCList while the actual state of the world contains VolumeGroups with the actual PVCList. The controller will try to reconcile the two by handling adding and removing multiple PVCs through a single CSI RPC call each time.

Note that filesystems based storage systems may not be able to support this RPC. For block based storage systems, this is a very convenient method. However, it may not satisfy the requirement for consistency as the volume is created without the knowledge of which group it is placed in. It is out of the scope of the CSI spec to determine whether a group is consistent or not. It is up to the storage provider to clarify that in the vendor specific documentation.

CSI drivers supporting VOLUME_GROUP_ADD_REMOVE_EXISTING_VOLUME MUST implement ModifyVolumeGroup RPC.

```
message ModifyVolumeGroupRequest {
  option (alpha_message) = true;

  // The ID of the volume group to be modified.
  // This field is REQUIRED.
  string volume_group_id = 1;

  // Specify volume_ids that will be in the modified volume group.
  // This list will be compared with the volume_ids in the existing group.
  // New ones will be added and missing ones will be removed.
  // If no volume_ids are provided, all existing volumes will
  // be removed from the group.
  // This field is OPTIONAL.
  repeated string volume_ids = 2;

  // Secrets required by plugin to complete volume group modification request.
  // This field is OPTIONAL. Refer to the `Secrets Requirements`
  // section on how to use this field.
  map<string, string> secrets = 3 [(csi_secret) = true];
}

message ModifyVolumeGroupResponse {
  option (alpha_message) = true;

  // Contains all attributes of the modified volume group.
  // This field is REQUIRED.
  VolumeGroup volume_group = 1;
}
```

#### ControllerGetVolumeGroup

```
message ControllerGetVolumeGroupRequest {
  option (alpha_message) = true;

  // The ID of the volume group to fetch current volume group information for.
  // This field is REQUIRED.
  string volume_group_id = 1;
}

message ControllerGetVolumeGroupResponse {
  option (alpha_message) = true;

  // This field is REQUIRED
  VolumeGroup volume_group = 1;
}
```

#### ListVolumeGroups

```
message ListVolumeGroupsRequest {
  option (alpha_message) = true;

  // If specified (non-zero value), the Plugin MUST NOT return more
  // entries than this number in the response. If the actual number of
  // entries is more than this number, the Plugin MUST set `next_token`
  // in the response which can be used to get the next page of entries
  // in the subsequent `ListVolumeGroups` call. This field is OPTIONAL. If
  // not specified (zero value), it means there is no restriction on the
  // number of entries that can be returned.
  // The value of this field MUST NOT be negative.
  int32 max_entries = 1;

  // A token to specify where to start paginating. Set this field to
  // `next_token` returned by a previous `ListVolumeGroups` call to get the
  // next page of entries. This field is OPTIONAL.
  // An empty string is equal to an unspecified field value.
  string starting_token = 2;
}

message ListVolumeGroupsResponse {
  option (alpha_message) = true;

  message Entry {
    // This field is REQUIRED
    VolumeGroup volume_group = 1;
  }

  repeated Entry entries = 1;

  // This token allows you to get the next page of entries for
  // `ListVolumeGroups` request. If the number of entries is larger than
  // `max_entries`, use the `next_token` as a value for the
  // `starting_token` field in the next `ListVolumeGroups` request. This
  // field is OPTIONAL.
  // An empty string is equal to an unspecified field value.
  string next_token = 2;
}
```

#### CreateVolumeGroupSnapshot

The purpose of this call is to request the creation of a multi-volume snapshot. Group snapshots can be created from existing volume group. Note that calls to this function must be idempotent - the function may be called multiple times for the same name - the group snapshot must only be created once.

```

### Alternatives

#### Immutable VolumeGroup

During the design discussions, an immutable VolumeGroup was considered but was removed because this would add lots of complexity to the design without much gain. It would also make it impossible to support the current way PVCs are provisioned in a Statefulset.

Immutable VolumeGroup - PVCList or PVC Selector in the ImmutableSource field in the Spec (optional field); PVCList is in the Status.
* Create a new VolumeGroup with existing PVCs by PVCList or PVC Selector in the Spec. The PVCList will be in the VolumeGroup Status as well.
* VolumeGroup Status has a boolean Mutable set to false.

```
ImmutableSource struct {
    PVCList
    Selector
}
```

```
// VolumeGroupSpec describes the common attributes of group storage devices
// and allows a Source for provider-specific attributes
Type VolumeGroupSpec struct {
        // +optional
        VolumeGroupClassName *string

        // If ImmutableSource is nil, an empty volume group will be created.
        // Otherwise, a volume group will be created with PVCs (if PVCList or Select is set)
        // If ImmutableSource is not nil, it indicates the VolumeGroup is immutable
        // +optional
        ImmutableSource *VolumeGroupSource
}

// VolumeGroupSource contains 3 options. If VolumeGroupSource is not nil,
// one of the 3 options must be defined.
Type VolumeGroupSource struct {
        // A list of existing persistent volume claims
        // +optional
        PVCList []PersistentVolumeClaim

        // A label query over existing persistent volume claims to be added to the volume group.
        // +optional
        Selector *metav1.LabelSelector
 }

type VolumeGroupStatus struct {
        // VolumeGroupId is a unique id returned by the CSI driver
        // to identify the VolumeGroup on the storage system.
        // If a storage system does not provide such an id, the
        // CSI driver can choose to return the VolumeGroup name.
        VolumeGroupId *string

        GroupCreationTime *metav1.Time

        // A list of persistent volume claims
        // +optional
        PVCList []PersistentVolumeClaim

        Ready *bool

        // Mutable indicates if a VolumeGroup can be modified
        // after it is created. If false, it indicates it cannot be
        // modified once created. If ImmutableSource is not nil
        // in VolumeGroupSpec, Mutable must be false; otherwise
        // it means the driver does not support ImmutableSource.
        // VOLUMEGROUP_IMMUTABLE and VOLUMEGROUP_MUTABLE capability
        // will be added to the CSI spec.
        Mutable *bool

        // If true, it indicates the CSI driver supports adding
        // an existing volume to the VolumeGroup and removing a
        // volume from the VolumeGroup without deleting it.
        // Only mutable VolumeGroup can support AddRemoveExistingPVC.
        // A corresponding VOLUMEGROUP_ADD_REMOVE_EXISTING_VOLUME
        // capability will be added to the CSI spec.
        AddRemoveExistingPVC *bool

        // Last error encountered during group creation
        Error *VolumeGroupError
}
```

VOLUMEGROUP_IMMUTABLE and VOLUMEGROUP_MUTABLE capability will be added to the CSI spec.
If VOLUMEGROUP_IMMUTABLE is supported, a VolumeGroup with an ImmutableSource can be created. Mutable will be false, PVCList will be set, and Ready will be true in the Status.
Otherwise, a VolumeGroup with an ImmutableSource will not be created successfully.

#### ModifyVolume

ModifyVolume CSI RPC was considered earlier to add/remove one volume to/from a group at a time but it was removed because ModifyVolumeGroup CSI RPC was added.

A new MODIFY_VOLUME capability will be added to support this.
It indicates that the controller plugin supports modifying a volume.

```
  rpc ModifyVolume(ModifyVolumeRequest)
    returns (ModifyVolumeResponse) {
        option (alpha_method) = true;
    }
```

This RPC is called when an existing volume is added to an existing volume group or when a volume is removed from the volume group.
A volume group id parameter will be in the ModifyVolumeRequest for an add request.
A volume group id parameter will not be in the ModifyVolumeRequest for a delete request.
If user requests to add an existing volume to a consistency group, but the CSI driver cannot fulfill the request because the existing volume is placed on a different storage pool from the consistency group, then the CSI driver MUST return failure.
This RPC MUST be idempotent.

```
message ModifyVolumeRequest {
      string volume_id = 1;

      // This field is OPTIONAL.
      repeated string volume_group_id = 2 [(alpha_field) = true];

      // Secrets required by plugin to complete modify volume request.
      // This field is OPTIONAL. Refer to the `Secrets Requirements`
      // section on how to use this field.
      map<string, string> secrets = 3 [(csi_secret) = true];
}
```
External-provisioner will be modified so that modifying PVC by adding VolumeGroupName will trigger a ModifyVolume call (a new CSI controller RPC) to CSI driver.

## Production Readiness Review Questionnaire

### Feature enablement and rollback

_This section must be completed when targeting alpha to a release._

* **How can this feature be enabled / disabled in a live cluster?**
  - [x] Other
    - Describe the mechanism:
      The external volume group and group snapshot controllers do not have a
      feature gate because they are out of tree.
      It is enabled when these external controller sidecars are deployed with the CSI driver.
    - Will enabling / disabling the feature require downtime of the control
      plane?
      From the controller side, it only affects the external controller sidecars.
    - Will enabling / disabling the feature require downtime or reprovisioning
      of a node? (Do not assume `Dynamic Kubelet Config` feature is enabled).
      No.

* **Does enabling the feature change any default behavior?**
  Yes. Enabling the feature can allow a new PVC to be created and added to a VolumeGroup. Enabling the feature can also allow a VolumeSnapshot to be created as part of the VolumeSnapshotGroup.

* **Can the feature be disabled once it has been enabled (i.e. can we rollback
  the enablement)?**
  Yes. All VolumeGroup and VolumeGroupSnapshot API objects need to be deleted before this feature can be truly disabled.

* **What happens if we reenable the feature if it was previously rolled back?**
  We will be able to create new VolumeGroup and VolumeGroupSnapshot API objects again.

* **Are there any tests for feature enablement/disablement?**
  Unit tests will be added for the in-tree feature enable/disablement.
  Since there is no feature gate for this feature on the external controller side and the only way to
  enable or disable this feature is to install or unistall the sidecar, we cannot write
  tests for feature enablement/disablement.

### Rollout, Upgrade and Rollback Planning

_This section must be completed when targeting beta graduation to a release._

* **How can a rollout fail? Can it impact already running workloads?**
  Try to be as paranoid as possible - e.g., what if some components will restart
   mid-rollout?

* **What specific metrics should inform a rollback?**

* **Were upgrade and rollback tested? Was the upgrade->downgrade->upgrade path tested?**

* **Is the rollout accompanied by any deprecations and/or removals of features, APIs,
fields of API types, flags, etc.?**
  Even if applying deprecation policies, they may still surprise some users.

### Monitoring Requirements

_This section must be completed when targeting beta graduation to a release._

* **How can an operator determine if the feature is in use by workloads?**
  Ideally, this should be a metric. Operations against the Kubernetes API (e.g.,
  checking if there are objects with field X set) may be a last resort. Avoid
  logs or events for this purpose.

* **What are the SLIs (Service Level Indicators) an operator can use to determine
the health of the service?**
  - [ ] Metrics
    - Metric name:
    - [Optional] Aggregation method:
    - Components exposing the metric:
  - [ ] Other (treat as last resort)
    - Details:

* **What are the reasonable SLOs (Service Level Objectives) for the above SLIs?**
  <!--
  At a high level, this usually will be in the form of "high percentile of SLI
  per day <= X". It's impossible to provide comprehensive guidance, but at the very
  high level (needs more precise definitions) those may be things like:
  - per-day percentage of API calls finishing with 5XX errors <= 1%
  - 99% percentile over day of absolute value from (job creation time minus expected
    job creation time) for cron job <= 10%
  - 99,9% of /health requests per day finish with 200 code
  -->

* **Are there any missing metrics that would be useful to have to improve observability
of this feature?**
  <!--
  Describe the metrics themselves and the reasons why they weren't added (e.g., cost,
  implementation difficulties, etc.).
  -->

### Dependencies

_This section must be completed when targeting beta graduation to a release._

* **Does this feature depend on any specific services running in the cluster?**
  Think about both cluster-level services (e.g. metrics-server) as well
  as node-level agents (e.g. specific version of CRI). Focus on external or
  optional services that are needed. For example, if this feature depends on
  a cloud provider API, or upon an external software-defined storage or network
  control plane.

  For each of these, fill in the followingâ€”thinking about running existing user workloads
  and creating new ones, as well as about cluster-level services (e.g. DNS):
  - [Dependency name]:
    - Usage description:
      - Impact of its outage on the feature:
      - Impact of its degraded performance or high-error rates on the feature:

### Scalability

_For alpha, this section is encouraged: reviewers should consider these questions
and attempt to answer them._

_For beta, this section is required: reviewers must answer these questions._

_For GA, this section is required: approvers should be able to confirm the
previous answers based on experience in the field._

* **Will enabling / using this feature result in any new API calls?**
  Describe them, providing:
  - API call type (e.g. PATCH pods): new APIs VolumeGroup, VolumeGroupContent, VolumeGroupClass, VolumeGroupSnapshot, VolumeGroupSnapshotContent, VolumeGroupSnapshotClass
  - estimated throughput
  - originating component(s) (e.g. Kubelet, Feature-X-controller)
  focusing mostly on:
  - components listing and/or watching resources they didn't before
  - API calls that may be triggered by changes of some Kubernetes resources
    (e.g. update of object X triggers new updates of object Y)

* **Will enabling / using this feature result in introducing new API types?**
  Describe them, providing:
  - API type:
  - Supported number of objects per cluster:
  - Supported number of objects per namespace (for namespace-scoped objects):

* **Will enabling / using this feature result in any new calls to the cloud
provider?**

* **Will enabling / using this feature result in increasing size or count of
the existing API objects?**
  Describe them, providing:
  - API type(s):
  - Estimated increase in size: (e.g., new annotation of size 32B):
  - Estimated amount of new objects: (e.g., new Object X for every existing Pod)

* **Will enabling / using this feature result in increasing time taken by any
operations covered by [existing SLIs/SLOs]?**
  Think about adding additional work or introducing new steps in between
  (e.g. need to do X to start a container), etc. Please describe the details.

* **Will enabling / using this feature result in non-negligible increase of
resource usage (CPU, RAM, disk, IO, ...) in any components?**
  Things to keep in mind include: additional in-memory state, additional
  non-trivial computations, excessive access to disks (including increased log
  volume), significant amount of data sent and/or received over network, etc.
  This through this both in small and large cases, again with respect to the
  [supported limits].

### Troubleshooting

The Troubleshooting section currently serves the `Playbook` role. We may consider
splitting it into a dedicated `Playbook` document (potentially with some monitoring
details). For now, we leave it here.

_This section must be completed when targeting beta graduation to a release._

* **How does this feature react if the API server and/or etcd is unavailable?**

* **What are other known failure modes?**
  For each of them, fill in the following information by copying the below template:
  - [Failure mode brief description]
    - Detection: How can it be detected via metrics? Stated another way:
      how can an operator troubleshoot without logging into a master or worker node?
    - Mitigations: What can be done to stop the bleeding, especially for already
      running user workloads?
    - Diagnostics: What are the useful log messages and their required logging
      levels that could help debug the issue?
      Not required until feature graduated to beta.

    - Testing: Are there any tests for failure mode? If not, describe why.

* **What steps should be taken if SLOs are not being met to determine the problem?**
